# OptimalCubeSolver
OptimalCubeSolver offers a streamlined solution for the 2x2 Rubik's Cube. Use the interactive 3D model to replicate your cube's configuration and receive an efficient, step-by-step guide to solve it. The core algorithm employs a "Meet in the middle" pathfinding technique, leveraging networkx and data science principles for minimal-move solutions.
